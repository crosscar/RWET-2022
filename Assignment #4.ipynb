       "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived\n",
       "alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had\n",
       "built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts,\n",
       "and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two\n",
       "years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life\n",
       "again.\n",
       "\n",
       "I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if\n",
       "very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning\n",
       "my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not\n",
       "appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances,\n",
       "very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did\n",
       "not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been\n",
       "curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable\n",
       "purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I\n",
       "maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no\n",
       "particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of\n",
       "these questions in this book. In most books, the _I_, or first person,\n",
       "is omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism,\n",
       "is the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after\n",
       "all, always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so\n",
       "much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well.\n",
       "Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my\n",
       "experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or\n",
       "last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what\n",
       "he has heard of other men’s lives; some such account as he would send\n",
       "to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it\n",
       "must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more\n",
       "particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers,\n",
       "they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will\n",
       "stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to\n",
       "him whom it fits.\n",
       "\n",
       "I would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and\n",
       "Sandwich Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in\n",
       "New England; something about your condition, especially your outward\n",
       "condition or circumstances in this world, in this town, what it is,\n",
       "whether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is, whether it cannot\n",
       "be improved as well as not. I have travelled a good deal in Concord;\n",
       "and everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have\n",
       "appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. What\n",
       "I have heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in\n",
       "the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downward,\n",
       "over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders “until it\n",
       "becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while\n",
       "from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the\n",
       "stomach;” or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or\n",
       "measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast\n",
       "empires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars,—even these\n",
       "forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing\n",
       "than the scenes which I daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules\n",
       "were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have\n",
       "undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end; but I could\n",
       "never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any\n",
       "labor. They have no friend Iolas to burn with a hot iron the root of\n",
       "the hydra’s head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.\n",
       "\n",
       "I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited\n",
       "farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more\n",
       "easily acquired than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the\n",
       "open pasture and suckled by a wolf, that they might have seen with\n",
       "clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in. Who made them\n",
       "serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is\n",
       "condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging\n",
       "their graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live a man’s\n",
       "life, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as they\n",
       "can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well nigh crushed and\n",
       "smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing\n",
       "before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never\n",
       "cleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and\n",
       "wood-lot! The portionless, who struggle with no such unnecessary\n",
       "inherited encumbrances, find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a\n",
       "few cubic feet of flesh.\n",
       "\n",
       "But men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon\n",
       "plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called\n",
       "necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up\n",
       "treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through\n",
       "and steal. It is a fool’s life, as they will find when they get to the\n",
       "end of it, if not before. It is said that Deucalion and Pyrrha created\n",
       "men by throwing stones over their heads behind them:—\n",
       "\n",
       "     Inde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,\n",
       "     Et documenta damus quâ simus origine nati.\n",
       "\n",
       "Or, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way,—\n",
       "\n",
       "     “From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,\n",
       "     Approving that our bodies of a stony nature are.”\n",
       "\n",
       "So much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle, throwing the\n",
       "stones over their heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.\n",
       "\n",
       "Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere\n",
       "ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and\n",
       "superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be\n",
       "plucked by them. Their fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy and\n",
       "tremble too much for that. Actually, the laboring man has not leisure\n",
       "for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the\n",
       "manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the\n",
       "market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he\n",
       "remember well his ignorance—which his growth requires—who has so often\n",
       "to use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously\n",
       "sometimes, and recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him.\n",
       "The finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be\n",
       "preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat\n",
       "ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to live, are\n",
       "sometimes, as it were, gasping for breath. I have no doubt that some of\n",
       "you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you\n",
       "have actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing\n",
       "or are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed\n",
       "or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an hour. It is very evident\n",
       "what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been\n",
       "whetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into\n",
       "business and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called\n",
       "by the Latins _æs alienum_, another’s brass, for some of their coins\n",
       "were made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other’s\n",
       "brass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying\n",
       "today, insolvent; seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many\n",
       "modes, only not state-prison offences; lying, flattering, voting,\n",
       "contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an\n",
       "atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade your\n",
       "neighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his coat, or his\n",
       "carriage, or import his groceries for him; making yourselves sick, that\n",
       "you may lay up something against a sick day, something to be tucked\n",
       "away in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or, more\n",
       "safely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter how much or how\n",
       "little.\n",
       "\n",
       "I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to\n",
       "attend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called Negro\n",
       "Slavery, there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both\n",
       "north and south. It is hard to have a southern overseer; it is worse to\n",
       "have a northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of\n",
       "yourself. Talk of a divinity in man! Look at the teamster on the\n",
       "highway, wending to market by day or night; does any divinity stir\n",
       "within him? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses! What is\n",
       "his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests? Does not he\n",
       "drive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how immortal, is he? See how\n",
       "he cowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not being\n",
       "immortal nor divine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of\n",
       "himself, a fame won by his own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant\n",
       "compared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself,\n",
       "that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate.\n",
       "Self-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the fancy and\n",
       "imagination,—what Wilberforce is there to bring that about? Think,\n",
       "also, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the\n",
       "last day, not to betray too green an interest in their fates! As if you\n",
       "could kill time without injuring eternity.\n",
       "\n",
       "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called\n",
       "resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go\n",
       "into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the\n",
       "bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is\n",
       "concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of\n",
       "mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is\n",
       "a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.\n",
       "\n",
       "When we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief\n",
       "end of man, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it\n",
       "appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living\n",
       "because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there\n",
       "is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun\n",
       "rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of\n",
       "thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What\n",
       "everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to\n",
       "be falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted\n",
       "for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What\n",
       "old people say you cannot do you try and find that you can. Old deeds\n",
       "for old people, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough\n",
       "once, perchance, to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going; new\n",
       "people put a little dry wood under a pot, and are whirled round the\n",
       "globe with the speed of birds, in a way to kill old people, as the\n",
       "phrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an\n",
       "instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost.\n",
       "One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned any thing of\n",
       "absolute value by living. Practically, the old have no very important\n",
       "advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and\n",
       "their lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as\n",
       "they must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which\n",
       "belies that experience, and they are only less young than they were. I\n",
       "have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the\n",
       "first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They\n",
       "have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me any thing to the\n",
       "purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me;\n",
       "but it does not avail me that they have tried it. If I have any\n",
       "experience which I think valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my\n",

       "\n",
       "One farmer says to me, “You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for\n",
       "it furnishes nothing to make bones with;” and so he religiously devotes\n",
       "a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of\n",
       "bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with\n",
       "vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plough along in spite\n",
       "of every obstacle. Some things are really necessaries of life in some\n",
       "circles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries\n",
       "merely, and in others still are entirely unknown.\n",
       "\n",
       "The whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by\n",
       "their predecessors, both the heights and the valleys, and all things to\n",
       "have been cared for. According to Evelyn, “the wise Solomon prescribed\n",
       "ordinances for the very distances of trees; and the Roman prætors have\n",
       "decided how often you may go into your neighbor’s land to gather the\n",
       "acorns which fall on it without trespass, and what share belongs to\n",
       "that neighbor.” Hippocrates has even left directions how we should cut\n",
       "our nails; that is, even with the ends of the fingers, neither shorter\n",
       "nor longer. Undoubtedly the very tedium and ennui which presume to have\n",
       "exhausted the variety and the joys of life are as old as Adam. But\n",
       "man’s capacities have never been measured; nor are we to judge of what\n",
       "he can do by any precedents, so little has been tried. Whatever have\n",
       "been thy failures hitherto, “be not afflicted, my child, for who shall\n",
       "assign to thee what thou hast left undone?”\n",
       "\n",
       "We might try our lives by a thousand simple tests; as, for instance,\n",
       "that the same sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of\n",
       "earths like ours. If I had remembered this it would have prevented some\n",
       "mistakes. This was not the light in which I hoed them. The stars are\n",
       "the apexes of what wonderful triangles! What distant and different\n",
       "beings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating the\n",
       "same one at the same moment! Nature and human life are as various as\n",
       "our several constitutions. Who shall say what prospect life offers to\n",
       "another? Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through\n",
       "each other’s eyes for an instant? We should live in all the ages of the\n",

       "him out as you did. He would not play any part. Men paid him wages for\n",
       "work, and so helped to feed and clothe him; but he never exchanged\n",
       "opinions with them. He was so simply and naturally humble—if he can be\n",
       "called humble who never aspires—that humility was no distinct quality\n",
       "in him, nor could he conceive of it. Wiser men were demigods to him. If\n",

       "responsibility on itself, and let him be forgotten still. He never\n",

       "wrote considerably, he thought for a long time that it was merely the\n",
       "handwriting which I meant, for he could write a remarkably good hand\n",
       "himself. I sometimes found the name of his native parish handsomely\n",

       "know whether he was as wise as Shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a\n",

       "\n",
       "His only books were an almanac and an arithmetic, in which last he was\n",
       "considerably expert. The former was a sort of cyclopædia to him, which\n",

       "does to a considerable extent. I loved to sound him on the various\n",
       "reforms of the day, and he never failed to look at them in the most\n",
       "simple and practical light. He had never heard of such things before.\n",
       "Could he do without factories? I asked. He had worn the home-made\n",

       "soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it, and thought that was\n",
       "better than water in warm weather. When I asked him if he could do\n",
       "without money, he showed the convenience of money in such a way as to\n",
       "suggest and coincide with the most philosophical accounts of the origin\n",
       "of this institution, and the very derivation of the word _pecunia_. If\n",
       "an ox were his property, and he wished to get needles and thread at the\n",
       "store, he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on\n",
       "mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount. He\n",
       "could defend many institutions better than any philosopher, because, in\n",

       "without, and some higher motive for living. “Satisfied!” said he; “some\n",

       "perhaps, if he has got enough, will be satisfied to sit all day with\n",
       "his back to the fire and his belly to the table, by George!” Yet I\n",
       "never, by any manœuvring, could get him to take the spiritual view of\n",

       "would any day walk ten miles to observe it, and it amounted to the\n",
       "re-origination of many of the institutions of society. Though he\n",
       "hesitated, and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly, he always\n",

       "drudgery, is perhaps never the worst form of idleness. It has a\n",
       "constant and imperishable moral, and to the scholar it yields a classic\n",

       "a stint, and washed the dust of labor from my person, or smoothed out\n",
       "the last wrinkle which study had made, and for the afternoon was\n",
       "absolutely free. Every day or two I strolled to the village to hear\n",
       "some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there, circulating\n",
       "either from mouth to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and which,\n",
       "taken in homœopathic doses, was really as refreshing in its way as the\n",
       "rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs. As I walked in the woods to\n",
       "see the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men\n",
       "and boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle.\n",
       "In one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the\n",
       "river meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other\n",

       "to support it, as once at Redding & Company’s on State Street, they\n",
       "kept nuts and raisins, or salt and meal and other groceries. Some have\n",
       "such a vast appetite for the former commodity, that is, the news, and\n",
       "such sound digestive organs, that they can sit forever in public\n",
       "avenues without stirring, and let it simmer and whisper through them\n",
       "like the Etesian winds, or as if inhaling ether, it only producing\n",
       "numbness and insensibility to pain,—otherwise it would often be painful\n",
       "to hear,—without affecting the consciousness. I hardly ever failed,\n",
       "when I rambled through the village, to see a row of such worthies,\n",
       "either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves, with their bodies\n",
       "inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and\n",
       "that, from time to time, with a voluptuous expression, or else leaning\n",
       "against a barn with their hands in their pockets, like caryatides, as\n",

       "and, as a necessary part of the machinery, they kept a bell, a big gun,\n",
       "and a fire-engine, at convenient places; and the houses were so\n",
       "arranged as to make the most of mankind, in lanes and fronting one\n",

       "woman, and child might get a lick at him. Of course, those who were\n",
       "stationed nearest to the head of the line, where they could most see\n",
       "and be seen, and have the first blow at him, paid the highest prices\n",
       "for their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts,\n",
       "where long gaps in the line began to occur, and the traveller could get\n",
       "over walls or turn aside into cow paths, and so escape, paid a very\n",

       "of the Sirens, and kept out of danger.” Sometimes I bolted suddenly,\n",
       "and nobody could tell my whereabouts, for I did not stand much about\n",

       "was aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch, I have not\n",
       "been able to recall a single step of my walk, and I have thought that\n",
       "perhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsake\n",
       "it, as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance. Several\n",
       "times, when a visitor chanced to stay into evening, and it proved a\n",
       "dark night, I was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear\n",
       "of the house, and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue,\n",
       "and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his\n",

       "who had been fishing in the pond. They lived about a mile off through\n",
       "the woods, and were quite used to the route. A day or two after one of\n",
       "them told me that they wandered about the greater part of the night,\n",
       "close by their own premises, and did not get home till toward morning,\n",
       "by which time, as there had been several heavy showers in the mean\n",

       "I have heard of many going astray even in the village streets, when the\n",
       "darkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife, as the saying\n",
       "is. Some who live in the outskirts, having come to town a-shopping in\n",
       "their wagons, have been obliged to put up for the night; and gentlemen\n",
       "and ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way,\n",
       "feeling the sidewalk only with their feet, and not knowing when they\n",
       "turned. It is a surprising and memorable, as well as valuable\n",
       "experience, to be lost in the woods any time. Often in a snow storm,\n",
       "even by day, one will come out upon a well-known road and yet find it\n",
       "impossible to tell which way leads to the village. Though he knows that\n",
       "he has travelled it a thousand times, he cannot recognize a feature in\n",
       "it, but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in Siberia. By\n",
       "night, of course, the perplexity is infinitely greater. In our most\n",

       "pilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands, and if we go beyond\n",
       "our usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some\n",

       "round,—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut\n",

       "liquid or solid.” But, looking directly down into our waters from a\n",
       "boat, they are seen to be of very different colors. Walden is blue at\n",
       "one time and green at another, even from the same point of view. Lying\n",
       "between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both.\n",
       "Viewed from a hill-top it reflects the color of the sky; but near at\n",
       "hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the\n",
       "sand, then a light green, which gradually deepens to a uniform dark\n",
       "green in the body of the pond. In some lights, viewed even from a\n",
       "hill-top, it is of a vivid green next the shore. Some have referred\n",
       "this to the reflection of the verdure; but it is equally green there\n",
       "against the railroad sand-bank, and in the spring, before the leaves\n",
       "are expanded, and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue\n",
       "mixed with the yellow of the sand. Such is the color of its iris. This\n",
       "is that portion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed by the\n",
       "heat of the sun reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted through\n",
       "the earth, melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen\n",
       "middle. Like the rest of our waters, when much agitated, in clear\n",
       "weather, so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the\n",
       "right angle, or because there is more light mixed with it, it appears\n",
       "at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself; and at such\n",
       "a time, being on its surface, and looking with divided vision, so as to\n",
       "see the reflection, I have discerned a matchless and indescribable\n",
       "light blue, such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades\n",
       "suggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating with the\n",
       "original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves, which last\n",
       "appeared but muddy in comparison. It is a vitreous greenish blue, as I\n",
       "remember it, like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloud\n",
       "vistas in the west before sundown. Yet a single glass of its water held\n",
       "up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air. It is well\n",
       "known that a large plate of glass will have a green tint, owing, as the\n",
       "makers say, to its “body,” but a small piece of the same will be\n",
       "colorless. How large a body of Walden water would be required to\n",
       "reflect a green tint I have never proved. The water of our river is\n",
       "black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it, and,\n",
       "like that of most ponds, imparts to the body of one bathing in it a\n",
       "yellowish tinge; but this water is of such crystalline purity that the\n",
       "body of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness, still more\n",
       "unnatural, which, as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal,\n",
       "produces a monstrous effect, making fit studies for a Michael Angelo.\n",
       "\n",
       "The water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at\n",
       "the depth of twenty-five or thirty feet. Paddling over it, you may see,\n",
       "many feet beneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners, perhaps\n",
       "only an inch long, yet the former easily distinguished by their\n",
       "transverse bars, and you think that they must be ascetic fish that find\n",
       "a subsistence there. Once, in the winter, many years ago, when I had\n",
       "been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel, as I\n",
       "stepped ashore I tossed my axe back on to the ice, but, as if some evil\n",
       "genius had directed it, it slid four or five rods directly into one of\n",
       "the holes, where the water was twenty-five feet deep. Out of curiosity,\n",
       "I lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until I saw the axe\n",
       "a little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and\n",
       "gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it\n",
       "might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the\n",
       "handle rotted off, if I had not disturbed it. Making another hole\n",
       "directly over it with an ice chisel which I had, and cutting down the\n",
       "longest birch which I could find in the neighborhood with my knife, I\n",
       "made a slip-noose, which I attached to its end, and, letting it down\n",
       "carefully, passed it over the knob of the handle, and drew it by a line\n",
       "along the birch, and so pulled the axe out again.\n",
       "\n",
       "The shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like\n",
       "paving stones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep\n",
       "that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your\n",
       "head; and were it not for its remarkable transparency, that would be\n",
       "the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side.\n",
       "Some think it is bottomless. It is nowhere muddy, and a casual observer\n",
       "would say that there were no weeds at all in it; and of noticeable\n",
       "plants, except in the little meadows recently overflowed, which do not\n",
       "properly belong to it, a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a\n",
       "bulrush, nor even a lily, yellow or white, but only a few small\n",
       "heart-leaves and potamogetons, and perhaps a water-target or two; all\n",
       "which however a bather might not perceive; and these plants are clean\n",
       "and bright like the element they grow in. The stones extend a rod or\n",
       "two into the water, and then the bottom is pure sand, except in the\n",
       "deepest parts, where there is usually a little sediment, probably from\n",
       "the decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many\n",
       "successive falls, and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even\n",
       "in midwinter.\n",
       "\n",
       "We have one other pond just like this, White Pond, in Nine Acre Corner,\n",
       "about two and a half miles westerly; but, though I am acquainted with\n",
       "most of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre I do not know a\n",
       "third of this pure and well-like character. Successive nations\n",
       "perchance have drank at, admired, and fathomed it, and passed away, and\n",
       "still its water is green and pellucid as ever. Not an intermitting\n",
       "spring! Perhaps on that spring morning when Adam and Eve were driven\n",
       "out of Eden Walden Pond was already in existence, and even then\n",
       "breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a\n",
       "southerly wind, and covered with myriads of ducks and geese, which had\n",
       "not heard of the fall, when still such pure lakes sufficed them. Even\n",
       "then it had commenced to rise and fall, and had clarified its waters\n",
       "and colored them of the hue they now wear, and obtained a patent of\n",
       "heaven to be the only Walden Pond in the world and distiller of\n",
       "celestial dews. Who knows in how many unremembered nations’ literatures\n",
       "this has been the Castalian Fountain? or what nymphs presided over it\n",
       "in the Golden Age? It is a gem of the first water which Concord wears\n",
       "in her coronet.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of\n",
       "their footsteps. I have been surprised to detect encircling the pond,\n",
       "even where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore, a narrow\n",
       "shelf-like path in the steep hill-side, alternately rising and falling,\n",
       "approaching and receding from the water’s edge, as old probably as the\n",
       "race of man here, worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters, and still\n",
       "from time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the\n",
       "land. This is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of\n",
       "the pond in winter, just after a light snow has fallen, appearing as a\n",
       "clear undulating white line, unobscured by weeds and twigs, and very\n",
       "obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is\n",
       "hardly distinguishable close at hand. The snow reprints it, as it were,\n",
       "in clear white type alto-relievo. The ornamented grounds of villas\n",
       "which will one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this.\n",
       "\n",
       "The pond rises and falls, but whether regularly or not, and within what\n",
       "period, nobody knows, though, as usual, many pretend to know. It is\n",
       "commonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer, though not\n",
       "corresponding to the general wet and dryness. I can remember when it\n",
       "was a foot or two lower, and also when it was at least five feet\n",
       "higher, than when I lived by it. There is a narrow sand-bar running\n",
       "into it, with very deep water on one side, on which I helped boil a\n",
       "kettle of chowder, some six rods from the main shore, about the year\n",
       "1824, which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years; and\n",
       "on the other hand, my friends used to listen with incredulity when I\n",
       "told them, that a few years later I was accustomed to fish from a boat\n",
       "in a secluded cove in the woods, fifteen rods from the only shore they\n",
       "knew, which place was long since converted into a meadow. But the pond\n",
       "has risen steadily for two years, and now, in the summer of ’52, is\n",
       "just five feet higher than when I lived there, or as high as it was\n",
       "thirty years ago, and fishing goes on again in the meadow. This makes a\n",
       "difference of level, at the outside, of six or seven feet; and yet the\n",
       "water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount, and\n",
       "this overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs.\n",
       "This same summer the pond has begun to fall again. It is remarkable\n",
       "that this fluctuation, whether periodical or not, appears thus to\n",
       "require many years for its accomplishment. I have observed one rise and\n",
       "a part of two falls, and I expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence\n",
       "the water will again be as low as I have ever known it. Flint’s Pond, a\n",
       "mile eastward, allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets\n",
       "and outlets, and the smaller intermediate ponds also, sympathize with\n",
       "Walden, and recently attained their greatest height at the same time\n",
       "with the latter. The same is true, as far as my observation goes, of\n",
       "White Pond.\n",
       "\n",
       "This rise and fall of Walden at long intervals serves this use at\n",
       "least; the water standing at this great height for a year or more,\n",
       "though it makes it difficult to walk round it, kills the shrubs and\n",
       "trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last rise,\n",
       "pitch-pines, birches, alders, aspens, and others, and, falling again,\n",
       "leaves an unobstructed shore; for, unlike many ponds and all waters\n",
       "which are subject to a daily tide, its shore is cleanest when the water\n",
       "is lowest. On the side of the pond next my house, a row of pitch pines\n",
       "fifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever, and\n",
       "thus a stop put to their encroachments; and their size indicates how\n",
       "many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height. By this\n",
       "fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore, and thus the _shore_\n",
       "is _shorn_, and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession. These\n",
       "are the lips of the lake on which no beard grows. It licks its chaps\n",
       "from time to time. When the water is at its height, the alders,\n",
       "willows, and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet\n",
       "long from all sides of their stems in the water, and to the height of\n",
       "three or four feet from the ground, in the effort to maintain\n",
       "themselves; and I have known the high-blueberry bushes about the shore,\n",
       "which commonly produce no fruit, bear an abundant crop under these\n",
       "circumstances.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved.\n",
       "My townsmen have all heard the tradition, the oldest people tell me\n",
       "that they heard it in their youth, that anciently the Indians were\n",
       "holding a pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high into the heavens\n",
       "as the pond now sinks deep into the earth, and they used much\n",
       "profanity, as the story goes, though this vice is one of which the\n",
       "Indians were never guilty, and while they were thus engaged the hill\n",
       "shook and suddenly sank, and only one old squaw, named Walden, escaped,\n",
       "and from her the pond was named. It has been conjectured that when the\n",
       "hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present\n",
       "shore. It is very certain, at any rate, that once there was no pond\n",
       "here, and now there is one; and this Indian fable does not in any\n",
       "respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom I have\n",
       "mentioned, who remembers so well when he first came here with his\n",
       "divining rod, saw a thin vapor rising from the sward, and the hazel\n",
       "pointed steadily downward, and he concluded to dig a well here. As for\n",
       "the stones, many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for\n",
       "by the action of the waves on these hills; but I observe that the\n",
       "surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones, so\n",
       "that they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides of\n",
       "the railroad cut nearest the pond; and, moreover, there are most stones\n",
       "where the shore is most abrupt; so that, unfortunately, it is no longer\n",
       "a mystery to me. I detect the paver. If the name was not derived from\n",
       "that of some English locality,—Saffron Walden, for instance,—one might\n",
       "suppose that it was called originally _Walled-in_ Pond.\n",
       "\n",
       "The pond was my well ready dug. For four months in the year its water\n",
       "is as cold as it is pure at all times; and I think that it is then as\n",
       "good as any, if not the best, in the town. In the winter, all water\n",
       "which is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which are\n",
       "protected from it. The temperature of the pond water which had stood in\n",
       "the room where I sat from five o’clock in the afternoon till noon the\n",
       "next day, the sixth of March, 1846, the thermometer having been up to\n",
       "65° or 70° some of the time, owing partly to the sun on the roof, was\n",
       "42°, or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in\n",
       "the village just drawn. The temperature of the Boiling Spring the same\n",
       "day was 45°, or the warmest of any water tried, though it is the\n",
       "coldest that I know of in summer, when, beside, shallow and stagnant\n",
       "surface water is not mingled with it. Moreover, in summer, Walden never\n",
       "becomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun, on account\n",
       "of its depth. In the warmest weather I usually placed a pailful in my\n",
       "cellar, where it became cool in the night, and remained so during the\n",
       "day; though I also resorted to a spring in the neighborhood. It was as\n",
       "good when a week old as the day it was dipped, and had no taste of the\n",
       "pump. Whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond, needs\n",
       "only bury a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to\n",
       "be independent of the luxury of ice.\n",
       "\n",
       "There have been caught in Walden pickerel, one weighing seven pounds,\n",
       "to say nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity,\n",
       "which the fisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did not\n",
       "see him, perch and pouts, some of each weighing over two pounds,\n",
       "shiners, chivins or roach (_Leuciscus pulchellus_), a very few breams,\n",
       "and a couple of eels, one weighing four pounds,—I am thus particular\n",
       "because the weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame, and\n",
       "these are the only eels I have heard of here;—also, I have a faint\n",
       "recollection of a little fish some five inches long, with silvery sides\n",
       "and a greenish back, somewhat dace-like in its character, which I\n",
       "mention here chiefly to link my facts to fable. Nevertheless, this pond\n",
       "is not very fertile in fish. Its pickerel, though not abundant, are its\n",
       "chief boast. I have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at\n",
       "least three different kinds; a long and shallow one, steel-colored,\n",
       "most like those caught in the river; a bright golden kind, with\n",
       "greenish reflections and remarkably deep, which is the most common\n",
       "here; and another, golden-colored, and shaped like the last, but\n",
       "peppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots, intermixed\n",
       "with a few faint blood-red ones, very much like a trout. The specific\n",
       "name _reticulatus_ would not apply to this; it should be _guttatus_\n",
       "rather. These are all very firm fish, and weigh more than their size\n",
       "promises. The shiners, pouts, and perch also, and indeed all the fishes\n",
       "which inhabit this pond, are much cleaner, handsomer, and firmer\n",
       "fleshed than those in the river and most other ponds, as the water is\n",
       "purer, and they can easily be distinguished from them. Probably many\n",
       "ichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them. There are also\n",
       "a clean race of frogs and tortoises, and a few muscels in it; muskrats\n",
       "and minks leave their traces about it, and occasionally a travelling\n",
       "mud-turtle visits it. Sometimes, when I pushed off my boat in the\n",
       "morning, I disturbed a great mud-turtle which had secreted himself\n",
       "under the boat in the night. Ducks and geese frequent it in the spring\n",
       "and fall, the white-bellied swallows (_Hirundo bicolor_) skim over it,\n",
       "and the peetweets (_Totanus macularius_) “teter” along its stony shores\n",
       "all summer. I have sometimes disturbed a fishhawk sitting on a\n",
       "white-pine over the water; but I doubt if it is ever profaned by the\n",
       "wing of a gull, like Fair Haven. At most, it tolerates one annual loon.\n",
       "These are all the animals of consequence which frequent it now.\n",
       "\n",
       "You may see from a boat, in calm weather, near the sandy eastern shore,\n",
       "where the water is eight or ten feet deep, and also in some other parts\n",
       "of the pond, some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a\n",
       "foot in height, consisting of small stones less than a hen’s egg in\n",
       "size, where all around is bare sand. At first you wonder if the Indians\n",
       "could have formed them on the ice for any purpose, and so, when the ice\n",
       "melted, they sank to the bottom; but they are too regular and some of\n",
       "them plainly too fresh for that. They are similar to those found in\n",
       "rivers; but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here, I know not by\n",
       "what fish they could be made. Perhaps they are the nests of the chivin.\n",
       "These lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom.\n",
       "\n",
       "The shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous. I have in my mind’s\n",
       "eye the western indented with deep bays, the bolder northern, and the\n",
       "beautifully scalloped southern shore, where successive capes overlap\n",
       "each other and suggest unexplored coves between. The forest has never\n",
       "so good a setting, nor is so distinctly beautiful, as when seen from\n",
       "the middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the water’s edge;\n",
       "for the water in which it is reflected not only makes the best\n",
       "foreground in such a case, but, with its winding shore, the most\n",
       "natural and agreeable boundary to it. There is no rawness nor\n",
       "imperfection in its edge there, as where the axe has cleared a part, or\n",
       "a cultivated field abuts on it. The trees have ample room to expand on\n",
       "the water side, and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in that\n",
       "direction. There Nature has woven a natural selvage, and the eye rises\n",
       "by just gradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highest\n",
       "trees. There are few traces of man’s hand to be seen. The water laves\n",
       "the shore as it did a thousand years ago.\n",
       "\n",
       "A lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is\n",
       "earth’s eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his\n",
       "own nature. The fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender\n",
       "eyelashes which fringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are\n",
       "its overhanging brows.\n",
       "\n",
       "Standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond, in a\n",
       "calm September afternoon, when a slight haze makes the opposite shore\n",
       "line indistinct, I have seen whence came the expression, “the glassy\n",
       "surface of a lake.” When you invert your head, it looks like a thread\n",
       "of finest gossamer stretched across the valley, and gleaming against\n",
       "the distant pine woods, separating one stratum of the atmosphere from\n",
       "another. You would think that you could walk dry under it to the\n",
       "opposite hills, and that the swallows which skim over might perch on\n",
       "it. Indeed, they sometimes dive below this line, as it were by mistake,\n",
       "and are undeceived. As you look over the pond westward you are obliged\n",
       "to employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as\n",
       "well as the true sun, for they are equally bright; and if, between the\n",
       "two, you survey its surface critically, it is literally as smooth as\n",
       "glass, except where the skater insects, at equal intervals scattered\n",
       "over its whole extent, by their motions in the sun produce the finest\n",
       "imaginable sparkle on it, or, perchance, a duck plumes itself, or, as I\n",
       "have said, a swallow skims so low as to touch it. It may be that in the\n",
       "distance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air, and\n",
       "there is one bright flash where it emerges, and another where it\n",
       "strikes the water; sometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed; or here\n",

       "in the forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid\n",
       "of his neighbors, he would take out the old yellow-pine. He sawed a\n",
       "channel in the ice toward the shore, and hauled it over and along and\n",
       "out on to the ice with oxen; but, before he had gone far in his work,\n",
       "he was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward, with the stumps\n",
       "of the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly fastened in the\n",

       "only for fuel, if for that. He had some of it in his shed then. There\n",

       "caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to\n",
       "have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost\n",
       "more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done\n",

       "a butterfly,” . . “and the gluttonous maggot when become a fly,”\n",
       "content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweet\n",
       "liquid. The abdomen under the wings of the butterfly still represents\n",
       "the larva. This is the tid-bit which tempts his insectivorous fate. The\n",
       "gross feeder is a man in the larva state; and there are whole nations\n",

       "may be done. The fruits eaten temperately need not make us ashamed of\n",
       "our appetites, nor interrupt the worthiest pursuits. But put an extra\n",
       "condiment into your dish, and it will poison you. It is not worth the\n",
       "while to live by rich cookery. Most men would feel shame if caught\n",
       "preparing with their own hands precisely such a dinner, whether of\n",

       "in the woods there was what was called a “winged cat” in one of the\n",
       "farm-houses in Lincoln nearest the pond, Mr. Gilian Baker’s. When I\n",
       "called to see her in June, 1842, she was gone a-hunting in the woods,\n",
       "as was her wont, (I am not sure whether it was a male or female, and so\n",
       "use the more common pronoun,) but her mistress told me that she came\n",
       "into the neighborhood a little more than a year before, in April, and\n",
       "was finally taken into their house; that she was of a dark\n",
       "brownish-gray color, with a white spot on her throat, and white feet,\n",
       "and had a large bushy tail like a fox; that in the winter the fur grew\n",
       "thick and flatted out along her sides, forming stripes ten or twelve\n",
       "inches long by two and a half wide, and under her chin like a muff, the\n",
       "upper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in the spring these\n",
       "appendages dropped off. They gave me a pair of her “wings,” which I\n",
       "keep still. There is no appearance of a membrane about them. Some\n",
       "thought it was part flying-squirrel or some other wild animal, which is\n",
       "not impossible, for, according to naturalists, prolific hybrids have\n",
       "been produced by the union of the marten and domestic cat. This would\n",
       "have been the right kind of cat for me to keep, if I had kept any; for\n",

       "In the fall the loon (_Colymbus glacialis_) came, as usual, to moult\n",
       "and bathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter\n",
       "before I had risen. At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen\n",
       "are on the alert, in gigs and on foot, two by two and three by three,\n",
       "with patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses. They come\n",

       "seen, though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the\n",

       "successful. When I went to get a pail of water early in the morning I\n",
       "frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few\n",

       "would manœuvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I did not\n",
       "discover him again, sometimes, till the latter part of the day. But I\n",
       "was more than a match for him on the surface. He commonly went off in a\n",

       "afternoon, for such days especially they settle on to the lakes, like\n",

       "suddenly one, sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods\n",
       "in front of me, set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself. I pursued\n",
       "with a paddle and he dived, but when he came up I was nearer than\n",
       "before. He dived again, but I miscalculated the direction he would\n",
       "take, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this\n",
       "time, for I had helped to widen the interval; and again he laughed long\n",
       "and loud, and with more reason than before. He manœuvred so cunningly\n",
       "that I could not get within half a dozen rods of him. Each time, when\n",
       "he came to the surface, turning his head this way and that, he cooly\n",
       "surveyed the water and the land, and apparently chose his course so\n",
       "that he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water and\n",
       "at the greatest distance from the boat. It was surprising how quickly\n",
       "he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution. He led me at\n",
       "once to the widest part of the pond, and could not be driven from it.\n",
       "While he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to\n",
       "divine his thought in mine. It was a pretty game, played on the smooth\n",
       "surface of the pond, a man against a loon. Suddenly your adversary’s\n",
       "checker disappears beneath the board, and the problem is to place yours\n",
       "nearest to where his will appear again. Sometimes he would come up\n",
       "unexpectedly on the opposite side of me, having apparently passed\n",
       "directly under the boat. So long-winded was he and so unweariable, that\n",
       "when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge again,\n",
       "nevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond,\n",
       "beneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a fish,\n",
       "for he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its\n",
       "deepest part. It is said that loons have been caught in the New York\n",
       "lakes eighty feet beneath the surface, with hooks set for trout,—though\n",
       "Walden is deeper than that. How surprised must the fishes be to see\n",
       "this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their\n",
       "schools! Yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on\n",
       "the surface, and swam much faster there. Once or twice I saw a ripple\n",
       "where he approached the surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre,\n",
       "and instantly dived again. I found that it was as well for me to rest\n",
       "on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where\n",
       "he would rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over\n",
       "the surface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly\n",
       "laugh behind me. But why, after displaying so much cunning, did he\n",
       "invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh? Did\n",
       "not his white breast enough betray him? He was indeed a silly loon, I\n",
       "thought. I could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up,\n",
       "and so also detected him. But after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever,\n",
       "dived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first. It was\n",
       "surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when\n",
       "he came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed feet\n",
       "beneath. His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like\n",
       "that of a water-fowl; but occasionally, when he had balked me most\n",
       "successfully and come up a long way off, he uttered a long-drawn\n",
       "unearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than any bird; as\n",
       "when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls. This\n",
       "was his looning,—perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here,\n",
       "making the woods ring far and wide. I concluded that he laughed in\n",
       "derision of my efforts, confident of his own resources. Though the sky\n",
       "was by this time overcast, the pond was so smooth that I could see\n",
       "where he broke the surface when I did not hear him. His white breast,\n",
       "the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the water were all\n",
       "against him. At length, having come up fifty rods off, he uttered one\n",
       "of those prolonged howls, as if calling on the god of loons to aid him,\n",
       "and immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled the\n",
       "surface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and I was impressed\n",
       "as if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was angry\n",
       "with me; and so I left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous\n",

       "the shallow in the latter pond, and the fact that a great proportion of\n",
       "it is comparatively shallow, show why it should break up so much sooner\n",
       "than Walden. The ice in the shallowest part was at this time several\n",
       "inches thinner than in the middle. In mid-winter the middle had been\n",
       "the warmest and the ice thinnest there. So, also, every one who has\n",

       "much warmer the water is close to the shore, where only three or four\n",
       "inches deep, than a little distance out, and on the surface where it is\n",
       "deep, than near the bottom. In spring the sun not only exerts an\n",

       "completely honeycombed, and at last disappears suddenly in a single\n",
       "spring rain. Ice has its grain as well as wood, and when a cake begins\n",
       "to rot or “comb,” that is, assume the appearance of honey-comb,\n",
       "whatever may be its position, the air cells are at right angles with\n",

       "dissolved by this reflected heat; and I have been told that in the\n",
       "experiment at Cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond,\n",
       "though the cold air circulated underneath, and so had access to both\n",
       "sides, the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than\n",
       "counterbalanced this advantage. When a warm rain in the middle of the\n",
       "winter melts off the snow-ice from Walden, and leaves a hard dark or\n",

       "morning. The day is an epitome of the year. The night is the winter,\n",
       "the morning and evening are the spring and fall, and the noon is the\n",
       "summer. The cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of\n",
       "temperature. One pleasant morning after a cold night, February 24th,\n",
       "1850, having gone to Flint’s Pond to spend the day, I noticed with\n",
       "surprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of my axe, it\n",
       "resounded like a gong for many rods around, or as if I had struck on a\n",
       "tight drum-head. The pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise,\n",
       "when it felt the influence of the sun’s rays slanted upon it from over\n",

       "gradually increasing tumult, which was kept up three or four hours. It\n",
       "took a short siesta at noon, and boomed once more toward night, as the\n",

       "pond fires its evening gun with great regularity. But in the middle of\n",
       "the day, being full of cracks, and the air also being less elastic, it\n",
       "had completely lost its resonance, and probably fishes and muskrats\n",
       "could not then have been stunned by a blow on it. The fishermen say\n",
       "that the “thundering of the pond” scares the fishes and prevents their\n",
       "biting. The pond does not thunder every evening, and I cannot tell\n",
       "surely when to expect its thundering; but though I may perceive no\n",
       "difference in the weather, it does. Who would have suspected so large\n",
       "and cold and thick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive? Yet it has its\n",
       "law to which it thunders obedience when it should as surely as the buds\n",
       "expand in the spring. The earth is all alive and covered with papillæ.\n",
